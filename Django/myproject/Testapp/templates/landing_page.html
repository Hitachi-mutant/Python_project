<p>while both MVC and MVT are design patterns used in web development, 
    Django follows the MVT pattern. In Django's MVT pattern, 
    the Model represents the data and business logic, 
    the View handles HTTP requests and contains some presentation logic, 
    and the Template handles the presentation and rendering of HTML. 
    This architecture helps in maintaining a clear separation of concerns 
    and allows for modular and maintainable code in Django web applications.</p>
